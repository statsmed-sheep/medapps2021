`medapps2021` contains tidy format data from [the Association of American Medical College's 2021 FACTS: Applicants and Matriculants Data website](https://www.aamc.org/data-reports/students-residents/interactive-data/2021-facts-applicants-and-matriculants-data). Datasets include the mean entrance exam scores and GPAs of medical school applicants and matriculants for the 2021-2022 admissions cycle across several different demographics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of medapps2021 like so:

``` {r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("statsmed-sheep/medapps2021")
```

## Data

* `astats_all`: mean total MCAT exam/sub-section scores and combined/science/non-science GPAs for all 2021-2022 applicants.
* `mstats_all`: mean total MCAT exam/sub-section scores and combined/science/non-science GPAs for all 2021-2022 matriculants.
* `astats_major`: mean total MCAT exam/sub-section scores and combined/science/non-science GPAs for all 2021-2022 applicants by undergraduate school major.
* `mstats_major`: mean total MCAT exam/sub-section scores and combined/science/non-science GPAs for all 2021-2022 matriculants by undergraduate school major.
* `astats_race`: mean total MCAT exam/sub-section scores and combined/science/non-science GPAs for all 2021-2022 applicants by race and ethnicity.
* `mstats_race`: mean total MCAT exam/sub-section scores and combined/science/non-science GPAs for all 2021-2022 matriculants by race and ethnicity.
* `astats_sex`: mean total MCAT exam/sub-section scores and combined/science/non-science GPAs for all 2021-2022 applicants by sex.
* `mstats_sex`: mean total MCAT exam/sub-section scores and combined/science/non-science GPAs for all 2021-2022 matriculants by sex.

## Example

The tidy format of the data allows the use of tidyverse packages like `dplyr` and `ggplot2` for data wrangling and visualization, respectively.

```{r example, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(medapps2021)

# Data wrangling

astats_ex <- astats_all %>% 
  filter(category == "Total Applicants")

# Data visualization

ggplot(astats_ex, aes(x = year, y = num_apps)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Medical School Applicants, 2018-2022", 
    x = "Admissions Cycle Year", 
    y = "Number of Applicants"
  )
```
